# üìò Content Review Guidelines for Organic Blog Articles

## Article Types & Purpose
Common blog content includes:  
- **Informational/Explainer** (in-depth coverage of a topic)  
- **How-to guides/tutorials** (step-by-step instructions)  
- **Product reviews**  
- **Product comparison or roundup posts**  
- **Listicles/Top-N lists**  
- **Gift/Buying guides**  

Each article should serve a clear purpose for readers. For example, a how-to guide should thoroughly explain each step, and a product comparison should objectively evaluate options. For monetizable content (reviews, comparisons, guides), clearly disclose affiliate relationships and focus on genuinely helping users ‚Äì avoid just copying manufacturer details.
