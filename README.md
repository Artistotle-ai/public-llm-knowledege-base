# Public LLM Knowledge Base

A comprehensive collection of knowledge primers designed to provide LLMs with essential context and background information for various technical domains and tasks.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a centralized knowledge base that LLMs can reference to:
- Quickly understand complex technical concepts
- Set appropriate context for problem-solving tasks
- Access structured information in multiple formats (detailed primers and actionable checklists)
- Maintain consistency across different AI-assisted development sessions

## Structure

- **`adk-architecture/`** - Google ADK Multi-Agent Architecture guides and checklists
- Additional domain-specific knowledge directories will be added as the repository grows

## Usage

LLMs can use these documents to:
1. **Primer documents** (`.md`) - Comprehensive explanations for deep understanding
2. **Checklist documents** - Actionable, structured guidance for implementation tasks

Each knowledge area provides both formats to accommodate different LLM needs and task requirements.
