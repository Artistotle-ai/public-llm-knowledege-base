# ADK Architecture Knowledge Base

This directory contains essential knowledge about Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) Multi-Agent Architecture, designed to help LLMs quickly understand and implement complex multi-agent systems.

## Contents

### ðŸ“š [ADK Architecture Primer](adk-architecture-primer.md)
A comprehensive guide covering:
- **Agent Types**: LLM Agents, Workflow Agents, and Custom Agents
- **Multi-Agent System Design**: Hierarchy, coordination patterns, and communication
- **Core Patterns**: Sequential pipelines, parallel execution, looping, and review/critique
- **Design Best Practices**: Single responsibility, clear interfaces, state management
- **Implementation Guidance**: Step-by-step approach to building robust multi-agent systems

### âœ… [ADK Architecture Checklist](adk-architecture-primer-checklist)
An actionable checklist format for LLMs to:
- Verify agent type selection
- Validate architecture patterns
- Ensure best practices are followed
- Guide quick flow design
- Support incremental testing and iteration

## Purpose

These documents provide LLMs with:
- **Quick Context Setting**: Essential ADK concepts and patterns
- **Implementation Guidance**: Structured approaches to multi-agent system design
- **Quality Assurance**: Best practices and validation checkpoints
- **Reference Material**: Comprehensive coverage of ADK multi-agent architecture

## When to Use

- **Primer**: For deep understanding, learning, and comprehensive planning
- **Checklist**: For implementation tasks, validation, and quick reference during development

Both formats contain the same core information, optimized for different LLM use cases and task requirements.
